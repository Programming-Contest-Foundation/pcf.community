In programming contests a team has a coach. A coach registers a team for the contest and is the main contact between 
the organisers of the contest and the team. There are other things a coach can do for a team. This article will
describe multiple types of duties a coach can take. There is no right (or wrong) way to coach a team and the roles 
described are meant as inspiration.

# Training of teams
The most obvious role linked to a coach is being the trainer of a team. You can train teams by practicing and explaining
the type of problems appearing in contests. There are multiple books published that can help you to do this. A small 
incomplete selection:
* [Competitive Programming 4th Edition](https://cpbook.net/) ([2nd edition downloadable for free](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=2))
* [Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Programming_Challenges.html)
* [Guide to Competitive Programming: Learning and Improving Algorithms Through Contests](https://books.google.nl/books?id=3JbiDwAAQBAJ)

Another option is to practice previous problems. This can be done in [open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) or using
the [CHipCie problem archive](https://commissies.ch.tudelft.nl/chipcie/archive). Having regular sessions where teams
practice in a simulated contest environment. Having a time with one computer available, factors on roles of team members
can be fine-tuned. Think about setting up the code environment, selecting the first problems and efficiently using the 
computer. 

# Preparing for a contest
A coach can help a team prepare for a contest. Most contest allow for a Team Reference Document (TRD, sometimes called 
Team Contest Reference (TCR)), sometimes may bring a keyboard and/or mouse and a dictionary. This information can
usually be found in the rules and systems pages on the website. If you can't find this information, don't hesitate
to contact to organisation to ask.

For TRD, a selection of following templates exist which can be used for a team as basis:
* [TU Delft template](https://commissies.ch.tudelft.nl/chipcie/resources/tcr-template.zip) ([pdf](https://commissies.ch.tudelft.nl/chipcie/resources/tcr.pdf))
* [Does god play Tetris](https://github.com/alexjbest/icpc-tcr/blob/master/teamref.pdf)
* [Let's party!](https://github.com/mzuenni/ContestReference/blob/new-master/tcr.pdf)
* [Omogen Heap](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/blob/main/kactl.pdf)

The TRD should be in a folder, or at least be stapled together. Make sure the teams bring a printed version to the 
contest, since not all contests offer the opportunity to print the document on site.

Other tips you can give your teams as coach is to check the schedule and see when/if there is dinner. If the award
ceremony is before the dinner, advice your teams to bring some snacks for after the contest. 

Another common issue is the temperature in the contest halls. It can heat up very fast with many people and pc's at the 
same time. Dressing in easily removable layers can help manage the temperature. Note that the T-shirt should usually
be worn on top and make sure your contestants are aware of it.

In case one of your team members has dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, nut allergy), make sure this is known by the organisation. In ICPC there is a special needs field the contestants should fill in. It depends per 
contest how this is handled. Making sure there is food that fits the needs of the contestant, as this greatly helps their results.

Also check the systems page if all expected IDEs are present. Sometimes teams prefer a specific IDE that is not listed.
Contacting the organisation beforehand has a better chance of it being available then during the contest.

# Travelling to the contest
An important part the coach can play is arranging funding for travel. Often the university is willing to support by 
financing (a part of) the travel expenses of the teams. 

## Benelux specific travel
Travel in the Netherlands can usually be done by public 
transport. The [NS group ticket](https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/meest-gekocht/p/groepsticket-daluren) can be a cheap way
to travel to the contest location. For trips outside the Netherlands sometimes a group trip will be organised in [the 
BAPC slack](/wiki/benelux-slack/).

## Hotels and youth hostels
Sometimes a host offers special deals on hotels. These are often the cheapest options available. Sometimes these are 
already available before you have selected your teams. You can usually already reserve them and give the names 
afterwards. 

# During the Contest
Not all coaches are attending the contest. This is highly recommended to do if you are able to. 

## During registration
By the on-site registration, make sure your teams hand everything in, such as keyboards to be checked. Depending on the
contest the TRD also should be hand in at registration or during the test session.

## During the Test Session
Make sure teams use the test session to test everything they might do during the contest. They should try everything,
including printing, sending in wrong submissions, sending a clarification request. An extensive list of things to check
is available on the [CHipCie Resources page](https://commissies.ch.tudelft.nl/chipcie/resources/).

## During the Contest
Teams are not allowed to have electronics on them. Not all contests offer facilities to safely store them and the 
contestants are instructed to store it by their coach. Make sure to bring something to store the devices in and let
them be put on silent or off. It's advisable to tell the teams to not bring laptops.

There is not much more you can do. You can check the scoreboard and report back to the fans at home through social media. 
There are usually meetings with all coaches and organisation to discuss future contest and to give feedback. 

## After the Contest
Teams are exhausted and ranging from happy to disappointed. The coach can both celebrate and comfort the teams. Make 
sure teams bring back their keyboards and give them back their electronics.
