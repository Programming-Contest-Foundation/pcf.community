# Community

Most of the discussions about our region in relation to BAPC happens during the actual event (For timings see bapc.eu) but during the rest of the year there is a semi-active community available on the SLACK.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to that community in the BAPC organisation slack which can be joined [here](https://join.slack.com/t/benelux-nwerc/shared_invite/zt-1b0k82fhd-ohLOpFhX1hnF7k5dlIgreg).

# Technical

The SLACK mentioned above has a lot of technical experienced people in setting up a contest but if you have a very specific usecase you might be interested in the [DOMjudge slack](https://www.domjudge.org/chat), or the [ICPC Tools](https://join.slack.com/t/icpctools/shared_invite/zt-wti6k1r6-t25~VYEcyKbVn4Vj_ecBLA). Please be aware that the people in these slacks might be in another timezone so are less useful for last minute questions.
