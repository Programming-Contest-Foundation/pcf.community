The PCF is commonly involved with two larger contest. The domains for these are `bapc.eu` and `nwerc.eu`. Listed below are guidelines on how to work with them and how to request changes.

For this description we take `bapc.eu` as the example domain. Any other domain can be substituted. The PCF can help with setting up with both a website and emailing.

## Setting up a website

It is recommended to host the website at `<year>.bacp.eu` as its canonical location. This ensures that older websites remain available and that `<year>`'s website will remain available in the future. Make `bapc.eu` and `www.bapc.eu` a redirect to `<year>.bapc.eu`. 

Other relevant domainnames could be:
- `judge.bapc.eu` for the jury to be used for Call For Problems(currently in use)
- `scoreboard.bapc.eu` for hosting the public scoreboard
- `open.bapc.eu` for hosting an open, public contest

After having setup your website check your website and domain settings using https://internet.nl. Our sponsor SURF prefers a maximum score on this test.

## Mail
The last few years it has been noticed that it is preferred to have consistent mailing for emails using a similar scheme as for the main website. e.g. mailing `organisation@1999.bapc.eu` will send an email to the organisers of the last BAPC before the burst of the dot-com bubble.

Similar to the website, `organisation@bapc.eu` can then become an alias to `organisation@<year>.bapc.eu`.

There are also more general emails, which should remain available. Specifically the address(es) the jury uses to send out the Call For Problems.

## Domain changes

Changes in the (sub)domain of `bapc.eu` and `nwerc.eu` can be requested by sending an email to: icpc@surf.nl, be aware that these will be handled during office hours.
