# Welcome to the Programming Contest Foundation

The Programming Contest Foundation is founded to support Programming Contests in the Netherlands, Benelux
and the rest of the world. The foundation is founded and supported by volunteers, consisting of organisers, judges and 
sysops from earlier editions of programming contests.

The mission is to provide knowledge and support in all aspects of holding a programming contest, with a focus on organizational challenges of the contest.

# Slack for Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest and Preliminaries 
For the BAPC region we maintain a Slack for organizers, judges, systems, coaches, and volunteers. If you are involved or interested
in getting involved in the BAPC or a preliminary, you are invited to join our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/benelux-nwerc/shared_invite/zt-1b0k82fhd-ohLOpFhX1hnF7k5dlIgreg).

# Wiki on how to organize contests
To support the contests we have two different wiki's, [one public](https://pcf.community/wiki/) and one with more sensitive content on request. To request access to the second one please ask in the Slack community.
