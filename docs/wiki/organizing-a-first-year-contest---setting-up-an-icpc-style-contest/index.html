        <p>One of the first activities a new organization can try is to host an event for first years to introduce them to Competive Programming. Currently the universities organize this independently but there have been years where problemsets have been shared. If this is the first time that you want to organize something like this feel free to tag people in the <a href="/Benelux-SLACK.md">Slack</a> and ask for help.</p>
<p>The general information (although very focused on the style chosen in the USA) can be found here: <a href="https://icpc.global/regionals/regional-contest-cookbook">https://icpc.global/regionals/regional-contest-cookbook</a>. In the BAPC region DOMjudge is chosen more often and for your first contest it is a good idea to ask if there is anyone who still has an instance available to make focussing on the contest easier. This is not because setting up the technical part is hard but more because a lot can go wrong in setting up your contest and outsourcing as much as possible is much easier to focus on all the things you might not have planned for.</p>
